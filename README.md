# hello-world
Well I, too, have followed the welcome guide.

I am a twenty-seven year old brazilian with a interest in creating a portfolio for the programming languages I plan to study. The first of those languages is gonna be Python, because it's easy and there's plenty of good textbooks to follow.

That's it for now.
